# Bioinspired MLP Optimization for High-Energy Physics

This repository explores the optimization of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architectures using Bioinspired Computing techniques, specifically **Genetic Algorithms (GA)**. It documents the evolution of a classification project, from its academic foundations to modern Pythonic implementations.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized to show the progression of the research and implementation:

* **`baseline-research-2024/`**: Initial experimental phase developed during the Bioinspired Computing course.
    * Focuses on manual heuristics ($n = 2 \cdot n_{a} + 1$) and early GA experiments.
* **`optimized-implementation-2026/`**: (In Progress) Refactored version applying advanced Python techniques and Genetic AI insights gained from recent specializations.



## Research Context

The primary goal is to distinguish between "background" and "signal" events in high-energy physics datasets. This problem serves as a benchmark for testing how evolutionary strategies can outperform manual architectural definitions.

### Technical Evolution:
1.  **Foundational Phase (2024):** Applying rigorous academic heuristics and basic GA search spaces to understand model behavior.
2.  **Advanced Phase (2026):** Implementing clean code principles, optimized data pipelines, and refined metaheuristics based on current industry standards.

## Key Technologies
* **Language:** Python 3.x (Advanced Techniques)
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn
* **Optimization:** Sklearn-genetic-opt (Evolutionary Strategies)
* **Data Processing:** Pandas, Numpy, MinMaxScaler
